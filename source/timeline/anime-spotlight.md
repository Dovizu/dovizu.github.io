AnimeSpotlight is a collaborative blog where each author owns his/her own program and focuses on reviewing anime titles. It's one of the two successors of [FM 139.7](/projects/fm1397) and was created to bring one of the most popular topics from FM 139.7 to a dedicated platform, so we could reach out to more people and earn followers by shifting our content focus to just be anime reviews.

### Content Positioning

Statistics from our previous site, FM 139.7, tell us that people really appreciated the substantial reviews we wrote. It was a distinguishing factor for the site, largely thanks to the beautiful and snarky reviews our program director Pete wrote. AnimeSpotlight was created entirely with this type of content in mind, and was designated for his anime reviewing program. We wanted to be really good at one thing.

### Platform & Design

SquareSpace, instead of WordPress, was our perfect choice at the time. We wanted to focus on design and content, and our blog had a pretty standard site structure. SquareSpace offered all of that and required no installation and maintenance. Today people would probably call this the "lean start" strategy: avoid operational overhead as much as possible when you're just testing the idea. 

Because the site was to be the home for high-quality articles on top-trending topics, I wanted visitors to "hear" the pulse of excitement and "feel" our dedication to quality. I started putting together elements that made me feel that way: vibrant and diffused shelf lights, modernist sky scrapers, texture of premium documents, glossy electronics, etc.. Inspired by all these textures and elements, What I arrived at is a template that sports a youthful look with a bold color palette and trendy element design, on top of a highly refined texture background with hints of soft lighting at appropriate places.

This was probably the very first serious web design project I did. Not much handwritten CSS was necessary at the time since most of my Photoshop mockups translate easily into SquareSpace's "GUI of CSS" interface.
